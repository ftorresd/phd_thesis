\section{Results for the inclusive category}

As stated before, this analysis was done, for the Z decay, taking into account a mutually excludent categorization of events, based on the reconstructed photon properties ($\eta_{SC}$ and R9 value), as described in section~\ref{sec:categorization}. 

For a matter of documentation, in table~\ref{tab:UpperLimits_Cat0} we present the results obtained when there is no categorization of events (inclusive category - Cat0).

\label{tab:UpperLimits_Cat0}
\end{center}
\end{table}


It is worth to remember that the categorization takes places only for the Z decay. For the Higgs decay, no categorization is imposed.
