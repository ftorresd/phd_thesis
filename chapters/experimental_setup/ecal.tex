The ECAL consists of 75\,848 lead tungstate crystals, which provide coverage in pseudorapidity $\abs{\eta} < 1.48 $ in a barrel region (EB) and $1.48 < \abs{\eta} < 3.0$ in two endcap regions (EE). Preshower detectors consisting of two planes of silicon sensors interleaved with a total of $3 X_0$ of lead are located in front of each EE detector \cite{Khachatryan:2015hwa}. In the barrel section of the ECAL, an energy resolution of about 1\% is achieved for unconverted or late-converting photons that have energies in the range of tens of GeV. The remaining barrel photons have a resolution of about 1.3\% up to a pseudorapidity of $\abs{\eta} = 1$, rising to about 2.5\% at $\abs{\eta} = 1.4$. In the endcaps, the resolution of unconverted or late-converting photons is about 2.5\%, while the remaining endcap photons have a resolution between 3 and 4\%~\cite{CMS:EGM-14-001}. When combining information from the entire detector, the jet energy resolution amounts typically to 15\% at 10\GeV, 8\% at 100\GeV, and 4\% at 1\TeV, to be compared to about 40\%, 12\%, and 5\% obtained when the ECAL and HCAL calorimeters alone are used.
