\subsection{RPC}

The Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) is the only muon detection technology present in both barrel and endcap. It has very good timing resolution and it is used mostly for triggering.

Due to the particularities of the study, especially the contributions given to the RPC project of CMS, Chapter~\ref{chapter_rpc} is devoted exclusively to this sub-detector.
