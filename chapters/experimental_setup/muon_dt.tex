Muons are measured in the pseudorapidity range $\abs{\eta} < 2.4$, with detection planes made using three technologies: drift tubes, cathode strip chambers, and resistive plate chambers. The single muon trigger efficiency exceeds 90\% over the full $\eta$ range, and the efficiency to reconstruct and identify muons is greater than 96\%. Matching muons to tracks measured in the silicon tracker results in a relative transverse momentum resolution, for muons with \pt up to 100\GeV, of 1\% in the barrel and 3\% in the endcaps. The \pt resolution in the barrel is better than 7\% for muons with \pt up to 1\TeV~\cite{Sirunyan:2018}. 

The muon detection system has nearly 1 million electronic channels.
