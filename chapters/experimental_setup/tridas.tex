\todo[inline]{FAZER!}

A two-tiered trigger system~\cite{Khachatryan:2016bia}. The first level (L1), composed of custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and muon detectors to select events at a rate of around 100\unit{kHz} within a time interval of less than 4\mus. The second level, known as the high-level trigger (HLT), consists of a farm of processors running a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast processing, and reduces the event rate to around 1\unit{kHz} before data storage.
