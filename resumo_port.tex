    This thesis presents the study on searches for rare decays of Standard Model bosons to quarkonia. The searches are performed on data collected during the 2016 data taking of the CMS detector, at center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. Standard Model Higgs and Z bosons decaying to a $\Upsilon(1S,2S,3S)$ and a photon, with subsequent decay of the $\Upsilon(1S,2S,3S)$ to $\mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ are performed using integrated luminosity of 35.86 $fb^{-1}$ from proton-proton collisions. No significant excess above the background-only assumption is observed. A limit at $95\%$ confidence level, is set on the $Z \rightarrow  \Upsilon(1S,2S,3S) + \gamma$ decay branching fraction at 2.9, 2.7, 1.4 $\times 10^{-6}$ and on $H\rightarrow  \Upsilon(1S,2S,3S) + \gamma$ decay branching fraction at  6.9, 7.4, 5.8 $\times 10^{-4}$, using the $CL_s$ method. Contributions given from 2016 to 2018 to the operation, maintenance and R\&D for Phase-2 Upgrade of Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) at CMS are also presented. This includes shift for the system operation, data certification for quality control, upgrade and maintenance of the online software and detector maintenance during the LHC Long Shutdown 2 (LS2.)
